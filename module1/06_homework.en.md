## Homework

### Post-work

<!-- * If you don't know what `operator %` is then you have to read about it. It will prove useful in homework :) -->
* Read about [std::string](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) in the documentation. You will find there, among others, description of `std::to_string` function. It will be useful üôÇ
* Task 1 - Calculate (5 points)
* Task 2 - Fibonacci - recursion and iteration (6 points)
<!-- * Task 3 - LCM and GCD (6 punkt√≥w) -->

#### Bonus for punctuality

For delivering each task before May 24, 2020 (Sunday) until 23:59 you will get 2 bonus points (4 points in total for 2 tasks).

### Pre-work

* Read about the [std :: vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) type documentation. Click on the different functions and look mainly at the usage examples at the bottom of the pages.
* You can look at the test files in the tasks and try to add your own test cases

#### [Repo tasks](https://github.com/coders-school/cpp-fundamentals/tree/master/module1/homework)

## Task 1 - Calculate

Implement a function whose task is to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers.

Signature - `std::string calculate(const std::string& command, int first, int second)`.

### Parameters

* `const std::string& command` - type of arithmetic operation. One of `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`
* `int first` - first number
* `int second` - second number

### Return value

* `std::string` - the result of the operation as text

In case of a wrong parameter `command` the function should return the string "Invalid data".

### Examples

```cpp
auto result = calculate("add", 2, 3);  // result = "5"
result = calculate("multiply", 2, 3);  // result = "6"
result = calculate("hello", 2, 3);     // result = "Invalid data"
```

___

## Task 2 - Fibonacci

Implement two functions. Both are supposed to count the n-th number of [Fibonacci sequence](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiƒÖg_Fibonacci), but in different ways.

* iterative (using loops)
* recursively (the function is supposed to call itself)

Functions must have specific signatures:

```cpp
int fibonacci_iterative(int sequence);
int fibonacci_recursive(int sequence);
```

## Task delivery

1. Fork a repo [cpp-fundamentals](https://github.com/coders-school/cpp-fundamentals)
2. Get your fork - `git clone https://github.com/YOURNICK/cpp-fundamentals.git`
3. Go to the cpp-fundamentals directory - `cd cpp-fundamentals`
4. Create a branch named `calculate` for calculate problem solution - `git checkout -b calculate`
5. Go to the directory module1/homework/calculate - `cd module1/homework/calculate`
6. Here is the backbone of the program that you must complete. It already includes tests to verify that your implementation is correct. Before starting the implementation, enter the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build   # creates build directory
cd build      # change directory to build
cmake ..      # generates Makefile by following instructions from ../CMakeLists.txt
make          # compilation
ctest -V      # running tests
```

7. Implement the functionality (piece by piece, e.g. start from adding operation only)
8. Check if the implementation passes the tests - `make` (compilation) and `ctest -V` (test launch)
9. Make a commit with a description of the functionality - `git commit -am"adding works"`
10. Go back to step 7 and implement next functionality. If the solution passes all tests, go to the next step
11. Push changes to your fork - `git push origin calculate`
12. Click on Pull Request on GitHub.
13. Wait a moment for the Continuous Integration (CI) report to see if the solution compiles and tests pass on GitHub as well.
14. If there is ‚úÖ - good job, the solution is correct. If there is ‚ùå click on it and check the error description. Correct it (points 7-11) and wait for the next CI report.

## Delivery of remaining tasks

First, go back to the main branch - `git checkout master` and proceed from step 4 for the next task (creating a new branch with a different name)

You may notice that switching to a different branch has resulted in you missing the solution for the first task. Don't worry, it's just on a different branch. You can return to it by going to the branch of this task - `git checkout nazwa`.
