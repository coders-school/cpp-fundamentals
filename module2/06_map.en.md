## Map, dictionary

* map is a set of pairs (key, value)
* `std::map` in C++ is equivalent to `dict` from Python

For example, we create a collection of favorite CDs and arrange them on a shelf.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
Of course, we have a huge number of these CDs and we would like to be able to find the CD easily when we search for it.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
For this purpose, we number all the CDs and write down information on a piece of paper under which number which title is placed. This is how we create a map.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

```cpp
std::map<size_t, std::string> discs {
    {1, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"},
    {2, "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"},
    {3, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"}
};
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

The key here is the number, while the value is the title of the movie.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

## Operations on `std::map`

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> beginning and end of range
  * `begin()`
  * `end()`
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> information about the number of items in the map
  * `size()`
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> information if the map is empty
  * `empty()`
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> access to the item for the specified key
  * `operator[key]`
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> adding a pair (key, value) to the map if such a pair does not exist in it yet
  * `insert({key, value})`

## Question

What will happen when we call on the mentioned map:

```cpp
discs[4] = "Harry Potter";
```

Assigning something to a map element with `operator[]` makes it so:
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> if there is already a value for a given key, we will replace it.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> if there is no value for a given key, we will create a new pair (key, value)

## Let's execute this code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

void Print(const std::map<size_t, std::string>& map) {
    for (const auto& pair : map) {
        std::cout << pair.first << " | " << pair.second << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    std::map<size_t, std::string> discs {
        {1, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"},
        {2, "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"},
        {3, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"}
    };

    Print(discs);
    std::cout << "\nAfter adding a new element\n";
    discs[4] = "Harry Potter";
    Print(discs);
    std::cout << "\nAfter modification of an element\n";
    discs[4] = "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone";
    Print(discs);
}
```

___

## Result

```txt
1 | The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
2 | The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
3 | The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King

After adding a new element
1 | The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
2 | The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
3 | The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
4 | Harry Potter

After modification of an element
1 | The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
2 | The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
3 | The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
4 | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
```

## Task

Write a function that takes `std::vector<int>` and `std::list<std::string>` and returns the map `std::map<int, std::string>`. [Download the task][task4]

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Implement createMap. It should take a vector and list and
// return a map of merge them as keys from the vector and values from the list


int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::list<std::string> list{"One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"};
    auto map = createMap(vec, list);

    for (const auto& pair : map)
        std::cout << pair.first << " | " << pair.second << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
